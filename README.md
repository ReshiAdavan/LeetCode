# LeetCode
My leetcoding journey
- Started off in C++ thinking it would be easy... it was not easy. 
- I only knew how to apply certain data structure & algorithm concepts - Binary Trees, LinkedLists, Sorting Algorithms, etc. 
- Re-learned data structures and algorithms in python. 
- Now I can complete LC mediums and have knowledge with most data structure & algorithm concepts. 
- So far so good...
