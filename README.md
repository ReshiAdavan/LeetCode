# LeetCode

My leetcoding journey

- The programming language you choose to LeetCode in doesn't actually matter. Preferably, you would want to LC in the lang you are best with/the company uses in their codebase.
- I am choosing Python as I prefer it for LC. I can focus more on problem-solving and analysis rather than syntax/programming lang concepts (memory deallocation in C/C++, static types in Java/C#, etc).
- Might LC in Golang out of interest, for concurrency and multi-threading, and since it is a popular choice in modern tech-stacks.
